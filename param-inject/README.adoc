= Parameter injection Example

This example is a proof of concept to add injection at parameter level in CDI. `ParamInjectInterceptor` intercept calls to replace invocation parameter by beans instance matching type and qualifier. In case of ambiguous or unsatisfied injection the interceptor will use the original invocation value for the parameter.
 To use the interceptor just annotate your method or class with `@InjectParams` interceptor binding.

== Launching test

You'll only need to choose one of the provided maven profiles for test. Profiles are :

* `owb-1.5` for OpenWebBeans 1.5.x tests
* `weld-2.2` for Weld 2.2.x tests
* `wildfly-8` for JBoss WildFly 8.x

Just launch `mvn -P<profile>` to launch test (for instance `mvn clean test -Powb-1.5` to test against OpenWebBeans).
Tests won't be launched without one of these profiles.
