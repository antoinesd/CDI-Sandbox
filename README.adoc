= This SandBox is an easy way to test CDI 1.2 features with different implementation

Thanks to Arquillian you can launch these test against :

* JBoss Weld 2.3.2 (version included in WildFly 10.0.0.Final)
* Apache OpenWebBeans 1.6.0
* JBoss WildFly 10.0.0

== Requirements

You'll need JDK 1.7 and Maven 3.x to launch these tests

== Launching test

You'll only need to choose of tof the provided maven profiles for test. Profiles are :

* `owb-1` for OpenWebBeans 1.6.x tests
* `weld-2` for Weld 2.3.x tests
* `wildfly` for JBoss WildFly 10.x

Just launch `mvn -P<profile>` to launch test (for instance `mvn clean test -Powb-1` to test against OpenWebBeans).
Tests won't be launched without one of these profiles.

== CDI 1.0

Checkout branch CDI-1.0 of this repository to get most of these example for CDI 1.0.
