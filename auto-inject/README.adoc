== Launching test

You'll only need to choose one of the provided maven profiles for test. Profiles are :

* `owb-1.5` for OpenWebBeans 1.5.x tests
* `weld-2.2` for Weld 2.2.x tests
* `wildfly-8` for JBoss WildFly 8.x

Just launch `mvn -P<profile>` to launch test (for instance `mvn clean test -Powb-1.5` to test against OpenWebBeans).
Tests won't be launched without one of these profiles.
